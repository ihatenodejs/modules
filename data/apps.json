If the official API is restricted (e.g. YouTube) for our purposes, or is proprietary, the app parses the website or uses an internal API instead. This means that you don't need an account on any service to use NewPipe.\n\nAlso, since they are free and open source software, neither the app nor the Extractor use any proprietary libraries or frameworks, such as Google Play Services. This means you can use NewPipe on devices or custom ROMs that do not have Google apps installed.\n\nTHIS APP IS IN BETA, SO YOU MAY ENCOUNTER BUGS. IF YOU DO, OPEN AN ISSUE IN THE NEWPIPE GITHUB REPOSITORY BY FILLING OUT THE ISSUE TEMPLATE.",

The goal is for users to easily flow from albums to photos to tags to maps, etc.\n\nAves integrates with Android (from KitKat to Android 14, including Android TV) with features such as widgets, app shortcuts, screen saver and global search handling.

    "description": "Android app to merge/'AntiSplit' split APKs (APKS/XAPK/APKM) to a regular .APK file\n\nThis project is a simple GUI implementation of Merge utilities from REAndroid APKEditor.\n\nThere are already some apps that can perform this task like Apktool M, AntiSplit G2, NP Manager, but they are all closed source.\n\nIn addition, Antisplit G2 (com.tilks.arscmerge), the fastest and lightest of the existing apps, has a large problem; it does not remove the information about splits in the APK from the AndroidManifest.xml. If a non-split APK contains this information it will cause an 'App not installed' error on some devices. Fortunately the implementation by REAndroid contains a function to remove this automatically and it carries over to this app.\n\n<b>Usage:</b>\n\nThere are 3 ways to open a split APK to be merged:\n- Share the file and select AntiSplit M in the share menu\n- Press (open) the file and select AntiSplit M in available options\n- Open the app from launcher and press the button then select the split APK file.\n\nThere is also a menu in the app that allows selecting an app from those installed on the device as a split APK.\n\n<b>Note:</b> An APK must be signed in order to install it (unless you have Core Patch). If you are planning to further modify the APK, you only need to sign it after the modifications. Some apps verify the signature of the APK or take other measures to check if the app was modified, which may cause it to crash on startup.",
